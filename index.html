        <p class="red" >Willis’ musical role in the band is noticeable
            as he sings in a melodious baritone voice.
            The Sauti Sol member is a vocalist, keytar,
            and saxophone player. Because of his 
            flamboyant style, the 31-year-old has

            born on July 9, 1987. He graduated with 
            a degree in Journalism & Media Studies
            from the University of Nairobi. After his degree,

        <p id="one"><em>Savara Mudigi</em></p><p style="color: magenta;">(producer, drummer, vocalist, DJ, and actor)</p>
        <ul>
            <img class="image" src="https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs72ccfoi581g.jpg" height="200"> </ul>
        <p class="red" >Savara is the other immensely talented vocalist 
            that captures the attention of the audience 
            whenever he sings. He is a producer, drummer, 
            vocalist, DJ, and actor. This incredible versatility <br> has 
            been a great addition to the Sauti Sol band.
            The vocalist <br> was born on May 25, 1987 and 
            raised in Kenya. He even studied <br>Commerce 
            and Finance at the Africa Nazarene University. 
            His girlfriend is <br> Endo. The two love birds 
            met at a concert in Nairobi </p>

        <p id="two">Polycarp Otieno</p> <p style="color: magenta;">(talented guitarist)</p>
        <img class="image" src="https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/72926684_108773063786143_2587732710188509430_n-959x600.jpg" height="200">
        <p class="blue">Polycarp, aka Fancy Fingers, is perhaps the <br> popular in the Sauti Sol music group as he doesn't sing.<br> And you know how tricky it is to stand out when<br> you are rarely part of the vocals that fans always <br> forward to. Nonetheless, the talented guitarist <br> managed to stay afloat in the band since its inception, <br> to the incredible bond the quartet shares.</p>
